                    Water sustains life on Earth. There are a number of natural reservoirs, including: oceans, glaciers,
                    rivers, lakes, atmospheric water vapor, groundwater and water retained in living beings. The
                    exchange between all reservoirs is described as the hydrologic cycle. In this, the cycle begins with
                    the precipitation of water on the Earth's surface, generating and maintaining glaciers on the polar
                    ice caps and on the tops of mountains. Part of the precipitation returns to the atmosphere and
                    accumulates with the evaporation of the biological activity of organisms. Once water reaches land it
                    seeps into the ground, supplying aquifers, rivers, lakes and the ocean.

            <p>The Northeast region suffers from a natural scarcity of water resources. It is supplied mainly with the
                use of dams and reservoirs. The North region is bathed by three hydrographic regions being its main
                supply. The Southeast region has great variability but is predominantly supplied by surface water
                reservoirs. The southern region is provided by aquifers and surface springs. The Midwest region is
                supplied by hydrographic regions.</p>

                        this waste, it contributes to surface contamination. Also noteworthy is the disposal of raw

                        improper disposal of residential sewage, either due to lack of basic sanitation or due to the
                        wrong choice of disposal site. In addition to the lack of treatment, the overcrowding of regions
